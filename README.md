Chrome extension for executing js scripts

Known issues:
1. Scripts can not be executed on non http/https browser pages (blank pages, chrome:// ,etc). 
For now I don't know workaround for that.

2. Extension popup becomes buggy after page reload (for example when script refreshed page). 
Workaround - close and reopen extension popup.
